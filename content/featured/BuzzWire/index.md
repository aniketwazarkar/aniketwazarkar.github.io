Developed a scalable and distributed real-time chat application supporting unicast, multicast, and broadcast messaging. Designed a horizontally scalable backend architecture utilizing Socket.io for WebSocket communication. Implemented Redis Pub/Sub for event consistency and HAProxy for load balancing.

Created message caching and persistence through Redis and MongoDB, ensuring low-latency communication. Containerized the application using Docker and orchestrated deployment with Docker Compose for seamless environment setup.
